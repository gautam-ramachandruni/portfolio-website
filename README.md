# Portfolio Website
This living repository of a portfolio application is used to iteratively improve my web application development skills and share my progress with employers and general enthusiasts.
For ease of access, the project has been made deployable on Heroku.

To run the application locally, running `serve` will immediately host it on port 5000.
